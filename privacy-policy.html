        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>JIMUNIM requires access to certain device permissions to provide its services effectively. Here's a breakdown of the information we collect and how we use it:</p>

        <p><strong>Permissions:</strong> READ_CONTACTS, WRITE_CONTACTS<br>
        <strong>Usage:</strong> We request access to your contacts to help you import and manage business contacts, such as employees, customers, vendors, and sellers. This data remains on your device and is not shared or transmitted to our servers.</p>

        <h3>b. Camera</h3>
        <p><strong>Permissions:</strong> CAMERA, android.hardware.camera, android.hardware.camera.autofocus<br>
        <strong>Usage:</strong> We use the camera to take photos, scan documents, or capture inventory images for business management. These photos are stored locally on your device or can be shared with external applications at your discretion. We do not store or transmit your photos to any external servers.</p>

        <h3>c. Storage</h3>
        <p><strong>Permissions:</strong> READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE, WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE<br>
        <strong>Usage:</strong> We request access to your device's storage to allow you to upload images, access files, save data, and share files via external applications (e.g., WhatsApp) to support your business operations.

        <h3>d. Internet Access</h3>
        <p><strong>Permissions:</strong> INTERNET<br>

        <h3>e. SMS Permissions</h3>
        <p><strong>Permissions:</strong> RECEIVE_SMS, READ_SMS, SEND_SMS<br>
        <strong>Usage:</strong> We use these permissions to automatically detect and fill in one-time passwords (OTPs) sent to your mobile number during login or registration for easier and faster account verification. We do not store or share your SMS data with any third parties, and it is used strictly for OTP capture.</p>

        <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
